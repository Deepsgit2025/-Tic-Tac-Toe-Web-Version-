# Tic-Tac-Toe-Web-Version
A modern, responsive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a browser-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 grid. The game automatically detects a winner and allows players to reset or start a new game.

🧠 How It Works

The game board is created using 9 button elements.
A boolean variable (turno) switches between O and X.
After each move: The script checks predefined winning patterns.
If a pattern matches → winner message is displayed.
All boxes are disabled after a win.
Reset/New Game clears the board and restarts play.
